I suggest extending/improving the already implemented integrations for the mod mentioned in the title.

## What should be added/changed exactly
<!-- Be as specific as possible. Don't just say "Add integration for mod xyz" or "Make entities from mod xyz convertible". This will be ignored. -->
<!-- Positive example: "Entity xyz should be convertible and have n blood. Also I would like to store blood in block/container xyz" -->

## I can help with
<!-- E.g. providing textures for something or testing builds -->


<!-- Optional -->
