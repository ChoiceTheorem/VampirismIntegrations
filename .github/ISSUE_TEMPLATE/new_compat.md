I would like to see integrations added for the mod mentioned in the title.  
I confirm it is available for the latest Minecraft version at the time of writing.

## About the mod
Link to the mod page (e.g. on CurseForge):

<!-- The mod must be Open Source or have an open API. Otherwise it is very unlikely this issue is considered -->
Link to mod source/API: 


## What should be integrated exactly
<!-- Be as specific as possible. Don't just say "Add integration for mod xyz" or "Make entities from mod xyz convertible". This will be ignored. -->
<!-- Positive example: "Entity xyz should be convertible and have n blood. Also I would like to store blood in block/container xyz" -->

## I can help with
<!-- E.g. providing textures for something or testing builds -->

## Additional comments
<!-- Optional -->
