## Vampirism Integrations Mod - WIP

Adds integrations for Vampirism with several other mods.

These integrations are implemented in this additional mod to:
- Keep Vampirism's project cleaner by having less dependencies
- Allow integrations to be updated seperate from the main mod
- Allow Vampirism to be updated seperate from the integrations (Allows faster updates of Vampirism for new MC version)
- Test Vampirism's API

Only the most important (and deeply integrated) ones are included in the main mod [JEI, GuideAPI]
